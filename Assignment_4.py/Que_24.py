Q.Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python?
Ans.
   Inheritance in Python is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit attributes and behavior from another class.
   
   The class being inherited from is called the parent or base class, and the class that inherits is called the child 
   or derived class. In Python, inheritance is defined using the syntax class ChildClass(ParentClass):.

   Inheritance is divided into 5 categories:
   
   1) single-level inheritance
   2) multi-level inheritance
   3) multiple inheritance
   4) heirarchical inheritance
   5) hybrid inheritance
